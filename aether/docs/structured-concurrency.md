# Structured Concurrency for Aether — Design Direction

Status: **proposal**. Nothing shipped yet. This doc captures the design
choices we've committed to before writing code, so the implementation PRs
have a target to aim at.

## What we're trying to fix

Aether has actors. It does not have:

- **A way for a parent to know when its children die.** If an actor
  handler panics or exits, no notification reaches the actor that spawned
  it. Long-running supervisor patterns (Erlang-style restart-on-crash,
  graceful shutdown of a subtree) can't be written.
- **Any containment on which actors a block can reach.** A function body
  can send a message to any actor reference it can name, and `hide` /
  `seal except` don't extend that restriction to concurrency sites (spawn,
  `!`, `ask`). A sealed block can still talk to any actor whose handle
  happens to be in scope.

Both are fixable without fundamentally changing the actor model.

## The design space — and why we picked what we picked

Six families of structured concurrency exist. The summary table:

| Model | Fit for Aether | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Nurseries / TaskGroups (Trio, Swift, Kotlin `coroutineScope`) | Needs a new "task" primitive distinct from actors | Possible, high cost |
| Supervision trees (Erlang/OTP, Akka) | Natural extension of existing actors | **Strong candidate** |
| Async/await (Rust, Kotlin, Swift) | Breaks run-to-completion, requires coloured functions | Ruled out |
| CSP / channels (Go, Clojure core.async) | Duplicates actor mailboxes | Ruled out |
| Fork-join (Cilk, Rayon, Java ForkJoinPool) | Complements actors for data parallelism | Nice-to-have, not core |
| Capability-scoped (E, Monte, Pony refcaps) | Builds on hide/seal, unique to Aether | **Strong candidate** |

### The two rulings worth unpacking

**Async/await is ruled out** because Aether's handlers are run-to-completion.
Introducing suspension points inside a handler would break the invariant
that makes the shared-nothing actor model safe: a handler either finishes
or panics, it doesn't yield. Async/await would also force **coloured
functions** (async vs sync), which splits the ecosystem — every stdlib
function becomes two functions, every actor becomes two kinds. Aether's
cooperative scheduler gets its simplicity from the run-to-completion
rule, and async/await would throw that away.

**CSP channels are ruled out** because Aether already has actor
mailboxes. A channel is a point-to-point typed queue with a send and a
receive end; an actor's mailbox is exactly that with an identity
attached. Adding channels on top would give users two ways to do the
same thing and force stdlib authors to pick one — usually the wrong one
for half their callers.

### The two we're building

**Supervision trees (#2)** solve the "who's responsible when a child dies"
problem. They're a library-level pattern on top of primitives the runtime
*doesn't yet expose but easily could*: actor failure notification.
Parents register interest in a child; if the child dies, the parent gets
a `Down { ref, reason }` message. Everything else — restart strategies,
escalation, graceful shutdown — is ordinary actor code on top of that
one primitive.

**Capability-scoped concurrency (#6)** solves the "who can reach whom"
problem. Aether already has `hide` and `seal except` for compile-time
capability denial on *variable* references. Extending that enforcement
to *actor* references means a sealed block cannot `spawn` a type it
can't name, cannot `!` a reference it can't see, and cannot `ask` an
actor outside its whitelist. **No new mechanism is needed** — just the
existing scope-denial check applied at two more compile-time sites
(spawn, send).

The two compose beautifully: a supervised subtree that is also sealed
gives you both bounded lifetime and bounded blast radius. No other
actor language pairs both.

## Phase 1 — supervision primitives

The runtime change needed is small: actor failure notification.

### What the runtime must expose

1. When an actor's handler returns abnormally — explicit `exit(reason)`,
   or a panic caught by the scheduler — the scheduler delivers a
   `Down { ref, reason }` message to every actor that registered
   interest in the failed actor.
2. Registration is one of two kinds:
   - **Monitor** — one-way. I get a `Down` if it dies; it doesn't hear
     about me dying.
   - **Link** — two-way (Erlang semantics). If either of us dies, the
     other gets a `Down`.
3. Delivery is best-effort at-most-once, routed through the normal
   mailbox. No new transport.

### Language / stdlib surface

```aether
// Builtins
monitor(actor_ref) -> monitor_id   // one-way
link(actor_ref)                     // two-way
demonitor(monitor_id)               // cancel monitor
unlink(actor_ref)                   // cancel link

// System message
message Down {
    ref: actor_ref
    reason: string    // "normal", "killed", or a user-supplied atom
}
```

### Supervisor as a library actor

No language-level supervisor primitive. A `std.supervise` module provides
an ordinary actor type:

```aether
import std.supervise

main() {
    sup = spawn(supervisor(strategy: "one_for_one")) {
        child("worker_a", || spawn(WorkerA()))
        child("worker_b", || spawn(WorkerB()))
        child("db_writer", || spawn(DbWriter()))
    }
}
```

The supervisor actor internally links each child, handles `Down`
messages according to its strategy, and decides whether to restart,
escalate, or shut the subtree down. Strategies mirror Erlang: `one_for_one`
(restart just the dead one), `one_for_all` (restart all siblings on any
death), `rest_for_one` (restart the dead one and everything started
after it).

Note the builder-DSL shape (`spawn(...) { child(...) child(...) }`) uses
the trailing-block + closure pattern that shipped with the closures and
embedded-namespaces features. The supervisor actor is the `_ctx` holder;
`child()` registers into it.

## Phase 2 — capability-scoped concurrency

Once Phase 1 is in, this is a compile-time-only change. No new runtime
mechanism.

### What the compiler must enforce

In a block that contains `hide X` or `seal except Y, Z`, every
concurrency site is checked against the same visibility rules already
applied to ordinary reads:

- `spawn(X())` — rejected if `X` is hidden or not on the seal whitelist.
- `ref ! Msg {}` — rejected if `ref` is hidden or not whitelisted.
- `ask ref { Request {} } after N` — same check on `ref`.

The error message reuses the existing `E0304` (hidden in this scope)
diagnostic.

### Worked example

```aether
sandbox("payment-handler") {
    grant_tcp("payments.example.com")
    seal except req, res, payment_client, logger

    // This block can only see the five whitelisted names.
    // It cannot spawn any actor type not named here.
    // It cannot send to any actor reference not named here.
    // It cannot ask any outside service.

    result = ask payment_client { Charge { amount: req.amount } } after 5000
    if result != null {
        logger ! Audit { who: req.user, what: "charged", amount: req.amount }
        res.status = 200
    } else {
        res.status = 502
    }
}
```

The subtree rooted at this block has both lifetime containment (the
`sandbox` scope's containment runtime) and capability containment (the
`seal except` list). A malicious or buggy handler cannot spawn a
crypto-miner actor because it cannot name one.

## What's not in scope

- **Fork-join / `parallel_for` (#5)** — useful for data parallelism,
  does not solve the lifecycle or reachability problem. Can be added
  later as a narrow stdlib feature layered on the existing
  work-stealing scheduler. Not part of this design.
- **Nurseries (#1)** — would require a second concurrency primitive
  (lightweight tasks distinct from actors). High cost for small
  marginal benefit given the actor model already exists. Revisit only
  if users ask for it after Phases 1 and 2 ship.
- **Channels (#4)** — actors already cover this. No plan.

## Order of work

1. **Runtime — `Down` message delivery.** Scheduler catches handler
   exits, iterates the monitor/link table, enqueues `Down` messages.
2. **Builtins — `monitor`, `link`, `demonitor`, `unlink`.** Thin
   wrappers over the runtime table.
3. **`std.supervise` module.** Supervisor actor type with the three
   strategies. Builder DSL for child registration.
4. **Tests.** Restart-on-crash, escalation, graceful shutdown, monitor
   vs link asymmetry, double-death ordering.
5. **Compiler — capability-scoped spawn/send/ask.** Extend existing
   `hide`/`seal except` denial to concurrency sites.
6. **Docs and worked example.** Update `docs/actor-concurrency.md` with
   the supervision section. One worked example in `examples/actors/`
   showing a supervised, sealed subtree.

Phase 1 can ship without Phase 2. Phase 2 can ship independently once
Phase 1 is in — they touch different compiler subsystems.
