# Closures and Environment Lifetimes

This document covers how closure environments are allocated, captured,
and freed, and the patterns that currently need workarounds. Earlier
rounds of the closure/DSL feature shipped with four capture-handling and
env-lifetime issues plus a chained typechecker hole that surfaced once
those four were resolved. All five landed together in a single PR
because testing any one in isolation was blocked by the others; they
are fixed on main and documented below as the underlying mechanism.

Three more closure-related bugs surfaced during the aether_ui toolkit
work: emission-ordering for cross-referenced closures, nested-lambda
return-type bubble-up, and captures across trailing blocks. All three
are fixed on main.

Five patterns are tracked — three around dynamic `call()` dispatch
(L1, L2, L3), one correctness hazard in closures inside actor handlers
(L4), and one memory-handling contract on closure-var reassignment
(L5). L4 is now rejected at compile time with a clear error; the rest
are documented with workarounds in the "Closure patterns and
workarounds" section below.

Regression tests live at `tests/syntax/test_closure_*.ae` and
`tests/integration/closure_*/`.

## The bugs

### 1. Captured `ptr` parameters typed `int`

A closure capturing a `ptr` parameter of its enclosing function got
`int <name>` in the env struct — pointer truncated on store, segfault on
deref. Capture-type resolution in `compiler/codegen/codegen_expr.c` walked
only top-level `AST_VARIABLE_DECLARATION` nodes across all functions and
returned the first match by name, so it never saw function parameters and
silently returned the type of any unrelated same-named variable elsewhere
in the program.

**Fix:** thread the enclosing function name through `discover_closures`
into each `ClosureInfo.parent_func`. Capture-type lookup now searches that
function's parameters (`AST_PATTERN_VARIABLE`) and its locals in nested
blocks first, only falling back to the program-wide scan when scope is
unknown.

### 2. Mutable captures miscompiled

`count = count + 1` inside a closure body emitted a shadowing local that
wrote to uninitialised stack — silent wrong answers, even in-scope. Two
collaborating problems: `is_local_var` treated any assignment target as a
fresh local, and the closure prologue unconditionally aliased each capture
to a read-only C local.

**Fix:** keep the alias pattern for read-only captures (zero cost), but
detect captures that are assigned to in the body and route their reads
and writes through `_env->name` directly. Scope analysis distinguishes
captures from fresh body-locals while honouring Python-style `x = expr`
shadowing: if the RHS does not read `x`, treat `x` as a fresh local.

**Semantics preserved:** closures capture by value (as documented in
`docs/closures-and-builder-dsl.md`). Mutations inside a closure mutate the
env's copy — which persists across calls — but are not visible to the
enclosing scope. Shared mutable state still requires ref cells.

### 3. Escaping-closure use-after-free

A closure variable `bump = || { ... }` pushed an unconditional
`free(bump.env)` onto the defer stack; at return the compiler emitted
every defer before returning, including the env-free of the closure being
returned. The caller received a closure whose env was already freed.

**Fix:** at return emission, walk the return expression to collect every
closure variable that appears (including `box_closure` wrappers) and
transitively any closure vars they capture. `emit_all_defers_protected`
skips the matching env-free defers and emits a
`/* deferred (suppressed: escapes via return) */` marker in their place.
Ownership transfers to the caller — matching the documented contract for
`box_closure`.

### 4. Closure return types hardcoded to `int`/`void`

The static `_closure_fn_N` wrapper was typed `int` (or `void`) regardless
of what the closure actually returned. Closures returning a string or
pointer either tripped `-Wint-conversion` and truncated the return, or
the caller cast through int and dereferenced a truncated pointer.

**Fix:** pick the return type from the returned expression's `node_type`.
For `return call(<captured_closure>)` chains the typechecker leaves the
inner call as `TYPE_INT`, so we resolve through the captured closure's
own body.

### 5. `call()` expression `node_type` stuck at `TYPE_INT`

The global `call` builtin is symbol-typed as `TYPE_INT`, so the
typechecker set `node_type=TYPE_INT` on every `call(x)` expression
regardless of what `x`'s closure actually returned. Downstream,
`print`/`println` picked `"%d"` for calls that really returned strings,
and `s = call(w)` declared `s` as `int` so later comparisons dereferenced
a truncated pointer.

**Fix:** a post-discovery pass walks the program and, for every
`call(<known_closure_var>)` expression, rewrites `node_type` to match the
closure's actual return type. It also back-propagates into variable
declarations whose initializer is such a call. `closure_var_map` seeding
is extended to inherit a closure id through `w = f()` when `f` ends
`return <closure_var>`, so chains like `w = build_pair(); call(w)`
resolve correctly.

### 6. Closure body references a later-numbered closure

A closure's body can construct inline closure literals and pass them
as arguments to other functions. Each lambda gets its own
`_closure_fn_N` in the emitted C. When the outer closure is numbered
before its inline lambdas, its body referenced `_closure_fn_N`
symbols that hadn't been declared yet at that point in the file.
Error: `'_closure_fn_N' undeclared`.

**Fix:** `emit_closure_definitions` now runs in two passes. Pass 1
emits every env typedef and every function prototype. Pass 2 emits
bodies and constructors. A closure body can reference any
`_closure_fn_N` by name regardless of numbering.

### 7. Nested lambda's return mis-typed the enclosing closure

`has_return_value` walked an AST subtree looking for return
statements with values. A nested lambda's `return` bubbled up and
mis-typed the enclosing closure as `int`, producing a
`static int _closure_fn_N(...) { ...; }` with no return statement —
undefined behavior caught by `-Wreturn-type`.

**Fix:** `has_return_value` stops at `AST_CLOSURE` boundaries. A
nested closure's return belongs to that closure, not to any
enclosing scope.

### 8. Captures across nested trailing blocks

A variable declared inside a trailing block (e.g.
`root = grid() { c = 42; ... }`) lives in the enclosing function's
scope because trailing blocks are inlined at the call site, not
hoisted. A closure inside a sibling or nested trailing block should
be able to capture such variables. Previously, capture discovery
stopped at `AST_CLOSURE` boundaries including trailing-block
closures (value == `"trailing"`), so names declared inside one
trailing block were invisible to inner closures.

**Fix:** scope-analysis helpers treat trailing-block closures
transparently while still stopping at real closures.
`subtree_declares` recurses through trailing blocks; a new
`scope_declares_at_top_level` helper is used by
`is_top_level_decl_in_function` to walk trailing blocks but NOT
nested if/for/while blocks — preserving the "fresh body-local in
nested block" Python-style rule that `calculator-tui` relies on.

## Code layout

Nearly all changes are in the codegen layer. The typechecker is unchanged.

| Concern | File |
|---------|------|
| Capture discovery, type resolution, return-type inference, `call()` node_type propagation | `compiler/codegen/codegen_expr.c` |
| Mutated-capture write path (routes through `_env->`) | `compiler/codegen/codegen_stmt.c` |
| Bug-3 return-defer protection | `compiler/codegen/codegen.c`, `codegen_stmt.c` |
| Small additions to `CodeGenerator` state | `compiler/codegen/codegen.h` |
| New helpers on the public header | `compiler/codegen/codegen_internal.h` |

## Closure patterns and workarounds

L1–L3 are ergonomic patterns with known workarounds you can apply today.
L4 is a compile-time rejection — previously silent wrong answers, now
surfaced at compile time with a clear error. L5 is a memory-handling
contract around reassignment. Each has a near-term workaround; the
"proper fix" notes describe the larger language work each leans on. See
[`docs/next-steps.md`](next-steps.md) for scheduling.

### L1. `call(x)` where `x` comes from a list

```aether
handlers = list.new()
list.add(handlers, box_closure(|_| { return "hello" }))
...
boxed = list.get(handlers, 0)
h = unbox_closure(boxed)
r = call(h)                   // h's return type is unknown at codegen
```

`call(h)` falls back to generic dispatch: `((int(*)(void*))h.fn)(h.env)`
— it assumes `int` return even if the stored closure returns a string
or pointer. Strings get their pointer truncated; pointers become
garbage.

**Workaround:** use a direct-literal closure variable when possible:
`action = |_| { ... }; call(action)` is statically resolved. Or accept
that `int`-returning dynamic closures are the only safely dispatchable
kind today.

**Why a quick `intptr_t` widening doesn't fix it:** the obvious patch —
emit `((intptr_t(*)(void*))h.fn)(h.env)` instead of `((int(*)(void*))`
— fixes the cast in isolation but leaves `r`'s declared C type as
`int`, so the return narrows right back. Widening `r` requires changing
the variable's registration in the symbol table (not just the AST
decl); downstream `print(r)` looks up `r`'s type from the symbol table
and picks `%d` for anything registered as `TYPE_INT`. Propagating
`TYPE_PTR` through the AST alone was attempted — it segfaulted four
existing tests whose `call(x)` returns are used in arithmetic or
comparisons. A real fix threads through the typechecker.

### L2. `call(x)` where `x` is chosen via `match`/`if`

```aether
op = if user_wants_add { add_fn } else { mul_fn }
r = call(op, 3, 4)            // op's closure id is not knowable
```

Same failure mode as L1. `closure_var_map` records a single closure id
per name, so branch-selected closures fall through to generic dispatch
with the `int` default.

### L3. `call(x)` where `x` is threaded through intermediate functions

```aether
x = setup()                   // setup returns a closure
y = wrap(x)                   // wrap takes fn, returns fn
r = call(y)                   // y's underlying closure is two hops away
```

`closure_var_map`'s `w = f()` inheritance (Bug 5's partial fix) only
handles one hop when `f`'s body ends `return <closure_var>`. Multi-hop
chains fall through to generic dispatch.

**Proper fix for L1/L2/L3:** parameterised closure types (`fn[T]`, like
Rust's `Fn(i32) -> i32`) or full typechecker return-type propagation.
Either is a medium-sized language feature — until it lands, the
workaround sections on each limit apply.

### L4. Closure inside actor handler mutating actor state

```aether
actor Counter {
    state count = 0
    receive {
        Go() -> {
            inc = || { count = count + 1 }   // rejected at compile time
            call(inc)
        }
    }
}
```

Closures inside actor handlers correctly capture and mutate arm-local
variables (Route 1 + arm promotion — tested by
`tests/syntax/test_closure_in_actor_handler.ae`). But when the closure
writes a name that's an actor **state field**, the closure has no
access to `self`, so state accesses would compile to unscoped local
reads — a silent wrong answer.

**Current status (as of this branch):** codegen walks every closure
body inside every actor receive-arm and, for each write to a state
field, emits a compile-time error pointing at the offending line with
a suggestion to use the arm-local workaround. Regression pinned by
`tests/integration/closure_actor_state_reject/`.

**Workaround:** copy state into an arm-local first, mutate that, then
write back. See `tests/syntax/README_closure_actor_state_limitation.md`
for the full pattern.

**Proper fix:** thread `self` through the closure's env so state
writes compile to `self->field = ...`. Medium-sized codegen change;
until it lands, the compile-time rejection prevents silent wrong
answers.

### L5. Closure-var reassignment leaks the previous env

```aether
op = |x: int| { return x + 1 }
op = |x: int| { return x * 2 }  // old env (malloc'd) is leaked
```

When a closure variable is reassigned, the auto-defer-free fires only
on the first assignment (to avoid double-free at scope exit, since
reassignment overwrites `.env` in the variable). The previous env's
heap block is unreachable — leaked.

**Why not just free on reassignment:** the old env may still be
reachable via a `box_closure()` copy or another closure's transitive
capture. Without escape analysis we can't tell if it's safe to free,
so we lean safe (leak) over unsafe (UAF).

Paired tests pin this trade-off:

- `tests/syntax/test_closure_reassign_leaks_env.ae` — 100-iteration
  reassignment loop exits cleanly.
- `tests/syntax/test_closure_reassign_after_box.ae` — box_closure'd
  copy survives reassignment of the source variable.

**Proper fix:** escape analysis. Track whether a closure variable has
been captured or stored anywhere before the reassignment; if not, free
on reassignment. Larger change; deferred.

## Why the UI calculator works

`examples/calculator-tui.ae` uses ref cells for all mutable state and
builds handlers as anonymous inline closures passed to `box_closure(...)`.
Ref cells sidestep bug 2 (the closure captures a pointer, read-only from
its perspective), and anonymous box-wrapped closures sidestep bug 3 (no
named variable, no defer-free insertion). It worked before these fixes
and still works.
