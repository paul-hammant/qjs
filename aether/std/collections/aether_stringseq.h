/* std.collections.string_seq — Erlang/Elixir-shaped cons-cell linked
 * list of string values.
 *
 * Empty list is the NULL pointer. Each cell carries a CACHED length
 * field so `string_seq_length(s)` is O(1) — Erlang's BEAM doesn't
 * cache length per cell because of its fixed compact cell layout;
 * Aether controls the layout, so we do.
 *
 * Cells are reference-counted to allow structural sharing without
 * copying:
 *
 *     t  = string_seq_cons("c",  string_seq_cons("d", NULL));
 *     a  = string_seq_cons("a",  t);   // shares t
 *     b  = string_seq_cons("b",  t);   // shares t
 *     string_seq_free(a);              // a frees, t stays alive for b
 *     string_seq_free(b);              // b frees, t now drops to 0 and frees
 *
 * Cells are also IMMUTABLE after creation — `cons` is the only
 * constructor; there's no `set_head` or `set_tail`. That makes
 * cycles impossible, so the iterative free below cannot loop, and
 * we don't need cycle detection on the spine.
 *
 * Operation complexity:
 *   empty / cons / head / tail / is_empty / length / retain : O(1)
 *   free                                                    : O(n) work,
 *                                                              O(1) stack
 *                                                              (iterative)
 *   from_array                                              : O(n)
 *   to_array                                                : O(n)
 *
 * Refcount semantics:
 *   - `cons(h, t)` retains BOTH `h` (via aether_string_retain) and
 *     `t` (via string_seq_retain). Callers that want to transfer
 *     their ref into the new cell call `string_seq_free` on the old
 *     local immediately afterward — see `string_seq_from_array` for
 *     the canonical builder pattern.
 *   - `retain(s)` bumps a cell's refcount; pair with `free(s)`.
 *   - `free(s)` decrements; if it reaches zero we release the head
 *     and walk to the tail. If a tail cell is still shared
 *     (refcount > 0 after decrement) we stop — the other owner
 *     finishes the walk later when its own free runs.
 *
 * Issue: motivated by the svn-aether port hitting a `string.split()`-
 * returning-`ptr` mismatch with `string[]` message fields. Cons cells
 * give a runtime-built sequence shape that fits actor messages
 * cleanly without forcing callers to plumb a separate `count` field.
