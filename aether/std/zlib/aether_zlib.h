/* std.zlib — one-shot zlib deflate/inflate.
 *
 * v1 exposes two pure functions that operate on in-memory byte
 * buffers. Streaming is deliberately out of scope (separate future
 * API); gzip-framed variants are additive and will land later under
 * the same module.
 *
 * The Aether boundary uses the split-accessor pattern (same as
 * fs.read_binary): a `try_` entry point performs the operation and
 * stashes the result in a thread-local buffer; `get_bytes` /
 * `get_length` read it borrowed; `release` frees the buffer early
 * (otherwise it's freed on the next `try_` call on the same thread).
 *
 * This avoids passing C out-parameters through the Aether calling
 * convention, and keeps the output binary-safe — the Aether wrapper
 * in module.ae copies the buffer into a length-aware AetherString
 * via string_new_with_length, preserving embedded NULs.
 *
 * When built without zlib (AETHER_HAS_ZLIB undefined — e.g. bare
 * embedded), `try_` returns 0 so the Go-style wrappers report
 * "zlib unavailable" cleanly.
