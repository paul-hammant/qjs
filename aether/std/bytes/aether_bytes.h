/* std.bytes — mutable byte buffer with random-access write and
 * overlap-safe forward copy_within.
 *
 * Aether's `string` is immutable; every concat allocates fresh. This
 * module fills the gap any binary-codec / streaming-buffer workload
 * needs: a buffer where you can set a byte at an arbitrary index and
 * read bytes that were written earlier in the same loop iteration.
 *
 * The canonical motivating case is the RLE overlap trick used by
 * svndiff and similar codecs:
 *
 *     for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
 *         dst[tpos + i] = dst[offset + i];   // offset < tpos
 *     }
 *
 * The action-1 instruction reads from a position that may itself
 * have just been written by a previous iteration of the same
 * instruction. memmove() is wrong here — it deliberately handles
 * overlap by choosing the safe direction; we want the unsafe forward
 * direction so byte i sees the freshly-written byte (i - run_length).
 *
 * Lifecycle: bytes.new() / set / copy_* / length, then either
 * bytes.finish(b, n) (hand off to a refcounted AetherString,
 * destroying the buffer) or bytes.free(b) (discard without
 * finishing). Issue #288.

 * would defeat the purpose. Grows the buffer if `dst + length`
 * exceeds capacity.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   - `src` must point into the buffer's current logical length
 *     (need at least one valid byte to read).
 *   - When `dst > src` (the RLE case), `src + length` may extend
 *     past the current tail; the loop reads bytes it just wrote.
 *   - When `dst <= src`, the full source range must already exist
 *     (no overlap-from-future-bytes story).

 * Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure (NULL buffer, negative offsets,
