# Regression test: defer + multi-value return.
#
# Bug: codegen for `return a, b` (or any multi-value return) inside
# a function that has any active `defer` saved the FIRST slot's
# value into _builder_ret typed as the first slot's type, then
# emitted `return _builder_ret;`. For a function returning
# (string, string, int), the C compiler then sees:
#
#   string _builder_ret = some_string_expr;
#   ...
#   return _builder_ret;   // expects _tuple_string_string_int
#
# and rejects with "incompatible types when returning type 'string'
# but '_tuple_string_string_int' was expected".
#
# Fix in compiler/codegen/codegen_stmt.c: when the return statement
# has multi-value children, emit the C-side tuple literal directly,
# skipping the typed-temp dance that single-value returns use.
#
# Surfaced during PR #255's head()/patch() wrappers — the natural
# `defer request_free(req)` form didn't compile, so those wrappers
# carry manual cleanup at each return site as a workaround. With
# this fix landed they can be cleaned up to use defer as intended.
