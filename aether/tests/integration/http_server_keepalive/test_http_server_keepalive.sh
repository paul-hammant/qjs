# #260 Tier 0: HTTP/1.1 keep-alive end-to-end.
#
# Drives 3 requests over a single TCP connection using curl's
# multi-URL form (which reuses the connection by default). Verifies:
#   - all 3 requests get 200 + body 'ka-ok'
#   - the server emits Connection: keep-alive on the first two
#     responses and Connection: close on the third (max=5 - 0 - 1
#     = 4 remaining after request #1; etc.)
#
# Skips cleanly when curl is missing.
