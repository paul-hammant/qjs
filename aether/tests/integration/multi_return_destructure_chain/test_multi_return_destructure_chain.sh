# Regression test: multi-value return that mixes a literal "" with a
# destructured local, inside a nested if-body, with a fall-through
# return that calls a tuple-typed function.
#
# ============================================================
# Why this exists — and the litmus test for the bug cluster
# ============================================================
#
# The Go-style (value, err) tuple-return migration in stdlib
# (std.map, std.list, std.fs, std.zlib, std.cryptography, ...) put
# weight on cross-function tuple-return inference. Several latent
# bugs in compiler/analysis/type_inference.c surfaced together only
# when *all four* of these shapes coincide in one function:
#
#   1. The body destructures a multi-value call into local idents.
#   2. One branch returns a tuple that mixes a literal ("") with
#      an ident that came from the destructure.
#   3. That branch lives inside an if/while/for body — not directly
#      inside the function's outermost block.
#   4. The fall-through return is a single-value call to a
#      tuple-typed function.
#
# Pre-fix, codegen emitted the offending function as
# `_tuple_string_int` (second slot decayed to int) and every
# downstream caller produced -Wint-conversion errors; runtime then
# segfaulted on the string-shaped slot. The shipped fixes carry
# the inline rationale at each fix site in
# compiler/analysis/type_inference.c — search for the
# "Bug #2 / #3 / #4" comments. Bug #1 (cross-module local-var
# pollution) shipped earlier in commit bc42939; its companion test
# is tests/integration/tuple_destructure_cross_module/.
#
# Litmus test for "is one of these regressing":
#   if codegen prints `unresolved type in codegen, defaulting to
#   int` on a function whose return mixes a destructured local
#   with a literal inside a nested if-body, one of the three fixes
#   in this commit is misbehaving.

#
# hash_file(p) walks the four-part shape:
#   bytes, length, rerr = fs.read_binary(p)        // (1) destructure
#   if string.length(rerr) > 0 {
#       return "", rerr                             // (2) literal +
#                                                   //     destructured local
#                                                   // (3) inside if-body
#   }
#   return cryptography.sha256_hex(bytes, length)   // (4) tuple-typed call
#
# Both branches return (string, string). The test's main() drives
# both — happy path against a real file, error path against a
# missing file — and asserts the second slot survives as a string
# all the way to the caller.

# ============================================================
# Bash invocation note

#
# Test harness now invokes via `bash` (PR #245); `set -eu` alone is
# enough — no pipefail dependency, no pipelines used.
