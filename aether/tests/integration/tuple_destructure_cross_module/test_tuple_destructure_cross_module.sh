# Regression test: tuple destructure with same local name across two
# imported modules should not produce E0200 "Type mismatch in variable
# initialization", and the caller should still see the destructured
# function's tuple-typed return.
#
# Bug history: upstream commit 7bc6c96 migrated std.map to Go-style
# tuple returns. aetherBuild/lib/build/module.ae and
# aetherBuild/lib/container/module.ae each declare a local `mod_name`
# (one as a string from a parameter assignment, the other as a ptr from
# a tuple destructure). With the symbol table pre-fix flat across all
# functions, the second module's `img_tag = mod_name` saw the wrong
# type and rejected with E0200.
#
# Fix: type_inference.c
#   - collect_function_constraints unwinds function-local symbols at
#     end-of-function so siblings don't see polluted types.
#   - resolve_local_var_type recognizes AST_TUPLE_DESTRUCTURE in
#     preceding siblings, so `return v` after `v, _ = some_call()`
#     resolves through the called function's tuple return type.
#   - infer_function_return_types is called inside the iteration loop
#     and re-publishes the freshly-inferred return types onto function
#     symbols so cross-function chains converge.
#   - infer_function_return_types re-tries when a function's previous
#     guess was VOID (otherwise an early UNKNOWN-resolved-as-VOID guess
#     sticks across iterations).
# Note: the test harness invokes this via `sh path/to/test.sh`, which
# resolves to dash on Ubuntu — dash does not implement `-o pipefail`,
# so this script avoids it. No pipelines are used below; `-eu` alone
# gives the safety we need (fail-fast on any non-zero, error on
# unset vars).
