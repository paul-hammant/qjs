# Integration regression for #286.
#
# Pre-fix: a bare-brace `{ ... }` block on the line after a
# function-call RHS was eaten as that call's trailing closure.
# References to the outer-scope variable from inside the
# synthesised closure body produced misleading "Undefined variable"
# diagnostics — the same shape as the 360-line failing file from
# the downstream svn-aether port.
#
# Post-fix: trailing-closure consumption requires `{` on the same
# line as the call's closing `)`. A `{` on a later line is parsed
# as an independent bare-brace block and sees outer locals via the
# ordinary lexical-scope chain.
#
# Pass: program compiles cleanly and prints "ok" on its own line.
