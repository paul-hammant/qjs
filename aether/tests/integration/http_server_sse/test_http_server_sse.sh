# the StartSrv message that opens the listening socket — on slower
# runners (Linux GHA, Windows GHA) the listener can be hundreds of
# ms behind READY, and a curl issued against the port too early
# returns no response at all (no Content-Type, no body — exactly
# the failure shape this guard is here to prevent). Probe the port
# directly until a HEAD succeeds; bail if the server died before
# binding.
