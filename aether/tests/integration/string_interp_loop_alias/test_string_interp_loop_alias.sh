# Issue #250 regression: string interpolation in accumulator loops
# where the LHS appears on the RHS — `out = "${out}…"`.
#
# Earlier, the codegen recycled the LHS's backing buffer between
# iterations, so iteration N+1 saw freed-then-reallocated bytes
# before the new content was written. Symptom: garbage prefix,
# correct suffix (e.g. "!d^?U### Request headers...").
#
# This test runs the program and compares stdout against a known-good
# expected output. A regression that produces garbage bytes shows up
# immediately as a diff. Test is portable: works on every host where
# `ae run` works (no ASAN required).
