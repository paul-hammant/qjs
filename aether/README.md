A compiled actor-based programming language with type inference, designed for concurrent systems. Aether compiles to C for native performance and seamless C interoperability.

## Overview

Aether is a compiled language that brings actor-based concurrency to systems programming. The compiler generates readable C code, providing portability and interoperability with existing C libraries.

**Core Features:**
- Actor-based concurrency with automatic multi-core scheduling
- Type inference with optional annotations
- Compiles to readable C for portability and C library interop
- Lock-free message passing with adaptive optimizations
- Three-layer capability model for sandboxing untrusted code and hosting other languages in-process — `--emit=lib` gates stdlib at compile time, `hide`/`seal except` gates scopes, LD_PRELOAD gates libc
- Go-style result types: `a, err = func()` with `_` discard
- Package management: `ae add host/user/repo[@version]` (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, any git host)

## Runtime Features

The Aether runtime implements a native actor system with optimized message passing:

### Concurrency Model
- **Multi-core partitioned scheduler** with locality-aware actor placement
- **Locality-aware spawning** — actors placed on the caller's core for efficient parent-child messaging
- **Message-driven migration** — communicating actors automatically converge onto the same core
- **Work-stealing fallback** for idle core balancing
- **Lock-free SPSC queues** for same-core messaging
- **Cross-core messaging** with lock-free mailboxes

### Memory Management
- **Manual by default** — use `defer` for cleanup. All allocations cleaned up explicitly.
- **Arena allocators** for actor lifetimes
- **Memory pools** with thread-local allocation
- **Actor pooling** reducing allocation overhead
- **Zero-copy message delivery** in single-actor main-thread mode (caller stack passed directly)

### Message Optimization
- **Sender-side batching** for reduced overhead
- **Message coalescing** for higher throughput
- **Adaptive batching** dynamically adjusts batch sizes
- **Direct send** for same-core actors bypasses queues

### Capabilities & Sandboxing

Aether is compiled, but comes with a capability system normally associated with interpreted / VM-hosted languages. Three enforcement layers:

- **Compile-time module gate** — `--emit=lib` rejects `std.fs` / `std.net` / `std.os` imports by default; the host opts each in with `--with=fs,net,os`.
- **Compile-time scope gate** — `hide <names>` and `seal except <allowlist>` on any lexical block (closure, trailing-block DSL, actor handler) block ambient names from leaking into contained code.
- **Runtime process gate** — `libaether_sandbox.so` (LD_PRELOAD) intercepts libc (`open*`, `connect`/`bind`, `execve`, `mmap`, `dlopen`, `getenv`) against a builder-DSL grant list; inherited across `execve` to child processes.

The same grant list + LD_PRELOAD also contains embedded interpreters — an Aether `main()` can host Lua, Python, Perl, Ruby, Tcl, and JavaScript in-process (`contrib.host.<lang>.run_sandboxed(perms, code)`) with the same permission model that scopes Aether's own libc calls. In the reverse direction, `--emit=lib` + `ae build --namespace` produce a `.so` plus a typed SDK (Python ctypes, Java Panama, Ruby Fiddle) so host-language apps can embed Aether without writing FFI by hand.

Mashup of Pony object capabilities, Java's removed SecurityManager, and a fraction of gVisor — see [Containment Sandbox](docs/containment-sandbox.md) for the full comparison, threat model, and known bypass surface.

### Platform Portability
- **Compile-time platform detection** via `AETHER_HAS_*` flags (threads, atomics, filesystem, networking, NUMA, SIMD, affinity)
- **Cooperative scheduler** for single-threaded platforms (WebAssembly, embedded, bare-metal)
- **Graceful degradation** — stdlib stubs return errors when features are unavailable
- **`ae build --target wasm`** compiles to WebAssembly via Emscripten
- **`PLATFORM=wasm|embedded`** Makefile targets for cross-compilation
- **Docker CI images** for Emscripten (WASM) and ARM (embedded) verification

### Advanced Features
- **Actor timeouts** — `receive { ... } after N -> { ... }` fires handler if no message arrives within N ms
- **Cooperative preemption** (opt-in) — `AETHER_PREEMPT=1` breaks long handlers, `--preempt` yields at loop back-edges
- **Reactor-pattern async I/O** — `net.await_io(fd)` suspends an actor on a file descriptor without blocking any scheduler thread; the runtime's per-core I/O poller (epoll/kqueue/poll) delivers an `IoReady { fd, events }` message when the fd becomes readable
- **SIMD batch processing** with AVX2 support
- **NUMA-aware allocation** for multi-socket systems
- **CPU feature detection** for runtime optimization selection
- **Performance profiling** with per-core cycle counting
- **Message tracing** for debugging

### Benchmarks

Cross-language benchmark suite based on the [Savina Actor Benchmark Suite](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2687357.2687368) — 11 languages × 5 patterns (ping-pong, counting, thread ring, fork-join, skynet). Both the benchmark runner and the visualization server are written in Aether, dogfooding the stdlib.

```bash
make benchmark    # Builds runner, runs all 55 benchmarks, opens UI at http://localhost:8080
```

See [Performance Benchmarks](docs/performance-benchmarks.md) for methodology and [benchmarks/cross-language/](benchmarks/cross-language/) for source.

## Quick Start

### Install

**Linux / macOS — one-line install:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolasmd87/aether.git
cd aether
./install.sh
```

Installs to `~/.aether` and adds `ae` to your PATH. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`.

**Windows — download and run:**

1. Download `aether-*-windows-x86_64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/nicolasmd87/aether/releases)
2. Extract to any folder (e.g. `C:\aether`)
3. Add `C:\aether\bin` to your PATH
4. **Restart your terminal** (so PATH takes effect)
5. Run `ae init hello && cd hello && ae run`

GCC is downloaded automatically the first time you run a program (~80 MB, one-time) — no MSYS2 or manual toolchain setup required.

**All platforms — manage versions with `ae version`:**

```bash
ae version list              # see all available releases
ae version install v0.25.0   # download and install a specific version
ae version use v0.25.0       # switch to that version
```

### Your First Program

```bash
# Create a new project
ae init hello
cd hello
ae run
```

Or run a single file directly:

```bash
ae run examples/basics/hello.ae
```

### Editor Setup (Optional)

Install syntax highlighting for a better coding experience:

**VS Code / Cursor:**
```bash
cd editor/vscode
./install.sh
```

This provides:
- Syntax highlighting with TextMate grammar
- Custom "Aether Erlang" dark theme
- `.ae` file icons

### Development Build (without installing)

If you prefer to build without installing:

```bash
make ae
./build/ae version
./build/ae run examples/basics/hello.ae
```

### The `ae` Command

`ae` is the single entry point for everything — like `go` or `cargo`:

```bash
ae init <name>           # Create a new project
ae run [file.ae]         # Compile and run (file or project)
ae build [file.ae]       # Compile to executable
ae check [file.ae]       # Type-check without compiling (skips codegen + link)
ae test [file|dir]       # Discover and run tests
ae examples [dir]        # Build all example programs
ae add <host/user/repo>  # Add a dependency (any git host)
ae repl                  # Start interactive REPL
ae cache                 # Show build cache info
ae cache clear           # Clear the build cache
ae version               # Show current version
ae version list          # List all available releases
ae version install <v>   # Install a specific version
ae version use <v>       # Switch to an installed version
ae help                  # Show all commands
```

In a project directory (with `aether.toml`), `ae run` and `ae build` compile `src/main.ae` as the program entry point. You can also pass `.` as the directory: `ae run .` or `ae build .`.

**Using Make (alternative):**

```bash
make compiler                    # Build compiler only
make ae                          # Build ae CLI tool
make test                        # Run runtime C test suite (166 tests)
make test-ae                     # Run .ae source tests (95 tests)
make test-all                    # Run all tests
make examples                    # Build all examples
make -j8                         # Parallel build
make help                        # Show all targets
```

### Building on Windows

The Aether build is GNU-make based. Use one of the two paths below — `nmake` from a Visual Studio Developer Prompt **will not work** (the Makefile uses GNU-only syntax that NMAKE can't parse).

**Just running Aether? Skip this section** and use the [release binary](https://github.com/nicolasmd87/aether/releases) — no MSYS2 setup required.

**Building from source — recommended (MSYS2 / MinGW-w64):**

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and open the **MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit** shell (not the bare MSYS shell).
2. Install the toolchain:
   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-make \
             mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib \
             mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates pkg-config make bc
   ```
3. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicolasmd87/aether.git
   cd aether
   make ci   # full suite: compiler, ae, stdlib, REPL, C tests, .ae tests, examples
   ```

For HTTPS to verify certs, the `mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates` package above provides the bundle at `/mingw64/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`. The runtime auto-detects it; if your install is in a non-standard location, export `SSL_CERT_FILE` to the bundle's Windows path.

**Native MSVC (cl.exe / nmake):** not currently supported as a full build path — tracker [#99](https://github.com/nicolasmd87/aether/issues/99). The MSVC matrix job in CI verifies our public headers parse under `cl.exe` so a future native MSVC port stays feasible, but `make` (the build system itself) requires GNU make. The MSYS2 MinGW build above is the supported source-build path for Windows today.

## Language Example

```aether
// Counter actor with message handling
message Increment {}
message Decrement {}
message Reset {}

actor Counter {
    state count = 0

    receive {
        Increment() -> {
            count = count + 1
        }
        Decrement() -> {
            count = count - 1
        }
        Reset() -> {
            count = 0
        }
    }
}

main() {
    // Spawn counter actor
    counter = spawn(Counter())

    // Send messages
    counter ! Increment {}
    counter ! Increment {}
    counter ! Decrement {}
    counter ! Reset {}
    counter ! Increment {}

    // Wait for all messages to be processed
    wait_for_idle()

    println("Final count: ${counter.count}")
}
```

## Closures and Builder DSL

Aether closures take three shapes after a function call. They look similar but have different semantics — picking the right one is the language's main lever for separating DSL structure from runtime behaviour.

| Mode | Syntax | Semantics |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Immediate** | `func() { block }` | Runs inline at the call site — used for DSL structure |
| **Closure** | `func() \|x\| { block }` | Real closure with explicit params, hoisted to a C function |
| **Callback** | `func() callback { block }` | Real closure that captures enclosing scope — no params needed |

```aether
// Immediate — declarative structure, runs during construction
panel("Settings") {
    button("OK")
    button("Cancel")
}

// Closure — explicit params, deferred invocation
apply_twice(x: int, f: fn) { return call(f, call(f, x)) }
doubler = |x: int| -> x * 2
println(apply_twice(3, doubler))    // 12

// Callback — captures from scope, runs when invoked
counter = ref(0)
btn("increment") callback { ref_set(counter, ref_get(counter) + 1) }
btn("decrement") callback { ref_set(counter, ref_get(counter) - 1) }
```

The compiler distinguishes them at parse time, which is what makes the sandboxing story (above) work: `hide`/`seal except` checks happen against the hoisted form of `closure` and `callback` blocks, so a `seal except req, res` on a callback body genuinely prevents the body from reaching outer scope. Immediate blocks inherit the caller's lexical scope by design — they're structure, not callbacks.

Inspired by Smalltalk blocks, Ruby's blocks/procs, Groovy closures, and Kotlin/SwiftUI's trailing-block DSLs. See [Closures and Builder DSL](docs/closures-and-builder-dsl.md) for the builder-context mechanism, ref cells, and full DSL pattern.

## Runtime Configuration

When embedding the Aether runtime in a C application, configure optimizations at startup:

```c
#include "runtime/aether_runtime.h"

int main() {
    // Auto-detect CPU features and enable optimizations
    aether_runtime_init(4, AETHER_FLAG_AUTO_DETECT);

    // Or manually configure
    aether_runtime_init(4,
        AETHER_FLAG_LOCKFREE_MAILBOX |
        AETHER_FLAG_ENABLE_SIMD |
        AETHER_FLAG_ENABLE_MWAIT
    );

    // Your actor system runs here

    return 0;
}
```

Available flags:
- `AETHER_FLAG_AUTO_DETECT` - Detect CPU features and enable optimizations
- `AETHER_FLAG_LOCKFREE_MAILBOX` - Use lock-free SPSC mailboxes
- `AETHER_FLAG_ENABLE_SIMD` - AVX2 vectorization for batch operations
- `AETHER_FLAG_ENABLE_MWAIT` - MWAIT-based idle (x86 only)
- `AETHER_FLAG_VERBOSE` - Print runtime configuration

## Optimization Tiers

The runtime employs a tiered optimization strategy:

**TIER 0 - Platform Capabilities (compile-time):**
- `AETHER_HAS_THREADS` — pthreads/Win32 threads (auto-detected; disabled on WASM/embedded)
- `AETHER_HAS_ATOMICS` — C11 stdatomic (fallback: volatile for single-threaded)
- `AETHER_HAS_FILESYSTEM` / `AETHER_HAS_NETWORKING` — stdlib feature gates
- `AETHER_HAS_SIMD` / `AETHER_HAS_NUMA` / `AETHER_HAS_AFFINITY` — hardware feature gates
- Override any flag with `-DAETHER_NO_<FEATURE>` (e.g. `-DAETHER_NO_THREADING`)

**TIER 1 - Always Enabled:**
- Actor pooling (reduces allocation overhead)
- Direct send for same-core actors (bypasses queues)
- Adaptive batching (adjusts batch size dynamically)
- Message coalescing (combines small messages)
- Thread-local message pools

**TIER 2 - Auto-Detected:**
- SIMD batch processing (requires AVX2/NEON)
- MWAIT idle (requires x86 MONITOR/MWAIT)
- CPU core pinning (OS-dependent)

**TIER 3 - Opt-In:**
- Lock-free mailbox (better under contention)
- Message deduplication (prevents duplicate processing)

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Runtime C test suite
make test

# Aether source tests
make test-ae

# All tests
make test-all

# Build all examples
make examples
```

### Testing

```bash
# Full CI suite (8 steps, -Werror) — runs on your current platform
make ci

# Unit tests only (166 tests)
make test

# Integration tests only (108 .ae tests)
make test-ae

# Build all examples (61 programs)
make examples

# Full CI + Valgrind + ASan in Docker (Linux)
make docker-ci
```

### Cross-Platform Testing

**CI runs automatically on:** Linux (GCC + Clang), macOS (ARM64 + x86_64), Windows (MinGW/MSYS2)

```bash
# Cooperative scheduler (no Docker needed)
make ci-coop

# Windows cross-compile syntax check (requires mingw-w64 or Docker)
make ci-windows              # needs: brew install mingw-w64
make docker-ci-windows       # or use Docker

# WebAssembly (requires Docker with Emscripten)
make docker-ci-wasm

# ARM embedded syntax check (requires Docker with arm-none-eabi-gcc)
make docker-ci-embedded

# All portability checks (coop + WASM + embedded)
make ci-portability
```

**`make ci` tests your current OS only.** No OS can locally test another OS natively — macOS cannot be virtualized on Linux/Windows, Windows build+run requires MSYS2. GitHub Actions CI automatically tests all 5 platform targets (Linux GCC, Linux Clang, macOS ARM64, macOS x86_64, Windows MinGW) on every PR. Docker targets (`docker-ci-windows`, `docker-ci-wasm`, `docker-ci-embedded`) provide cross-compilation syntax checking from any host.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full pre-PR checklist.

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run cross-language benchmark suite with interactive UI
make benchmark
# Open http://localhost:8080 to view results

```

The benchmark runner is written in Aether (`run_benchmarks.ae`), dogfooding the stdlib. It compiles and runs all 11 languages, parses output, and writes JSON results.
